Experiments with Scala

## Scala Installation

A good idea is to install the stand-alone zip (instead of msi for Windows) sbt version.
Stand alone versions are always best becuase you can have multiple versions available
on the same machine. If you want to use a different version, then all you need to do
is type the full path of sbt of you want to use, or change the path pointing to sbt.

scala repl needs to be separately installed in addition to sbt.

## Notes

- git ignore target and null paths
- :q to quit scala repl
